## 🧭 Why I Made This

Every developer needs a space that reflects who they are — this is mine.  
It’s clean, intentional, and built from the ground up to:

- Showcase what I can do
- Document what I'm learning
- Make it easy to connect with people who share the same drive

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just exploring — I hope you leave inspired, or at least a little curious.
